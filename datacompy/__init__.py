"""DataComPy is a package to compare two Pandas DataFrames.

Originally started to be something of a replacement for SAS's PROC COMPARE for Pandas DataFrames with some more functionality than just Pandas.DataFrame.equals(Pandas.DataFrame) (in that it prints out some stats, and lets you tweak how accurate matches have to be).
Then extended to carry that functionality over to Spark Dataframes.
