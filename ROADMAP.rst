datacompy Roadmap
-----------------

At this current time ``datacompy`` is in a stable state. We are planning on continuing to
add features and functionality as the community of users asks for them, but there are no 
pressing issues which we are looking to add in immediately.

There are some longer term issues which are open for people to work on, and some which are more of a nice to have.
We are looking for contributors and also maintaners to help with the project.

- Add in docs how to change the number of mismatches in report `#6 <https://github.com/capitalone/datacompy/issues/6>`_
- Make duplicate handling better `#7 <https://github.com/capitalone/datacompy/issues/7>`_
- Refactor Spark datacompy   `#13 <https://github.com/capitalone/datacompy/issues/13>`_
- Drop Python 3.7 suport  `#173 <https://github.com/capitalone/datacompy/issues/173>`_
