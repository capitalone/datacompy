DataComPy is a package to compare two DataFrames (or tables) such as Pandas, Spark, Polars, and
even Snowflake. Originally it was created to be something of a replacement
for SAS's ``PROC COMPARE`` for Pandas DataFrames with some more functionality than
just ``Pandas.DataFrame.equals(Pandas.DataFrame)`` (in that it prints out some stats,
and lets you tweak how accurate matches have to be). Supported types include:

- Pandas
- Polars
- Spark
- Snowflake


## Quick Installation

```shell
pip install datacompy
```

or

```shell
